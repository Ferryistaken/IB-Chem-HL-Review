# First Ionization Energy
- Decreases down a group (look at [[Periodic Table#Trends]])
- Increases along a period (look at [[Periodic Table#Trends]])
- Shows regular dicontinuities in the increases across a period
- Large increases in successive ionization energies of an atom occur when an electron is removed from a different energy level.
- Smaller increases occur when an electron is removed from a different sub level
