# Equilibrium Constant $K_c$

In the reaction:
$$
aA + bB \Longleftrightarrow cC + dD
$$
The rate of reaction $K_c$ can be defined as:
$$
K_c = \frac{[C]^{c}_{eqm} [D]^{d}_{eqm}}{[A]^{a}_{eqm} [B]^{b}_{eqm}}
$$
Or, **the concentration of the products at equilibrium elevated to their coefficients over the concentration of the reactants at equilibrium elevated by their coefficients**

A high $K_c$ value means that there are more products than reactants, a low value of $K_c$ tells us the opposite.
