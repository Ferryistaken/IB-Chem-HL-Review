# Equilibrium
## Features of Equilibrium:
 Feature:  | Explanation
 --------- | -----------
 Dynamic   | The reaction doesn't stop but both forward and backward reactions are happening at the same rate 
 Achieved in a close system | A closed system has no exchange with its surroundings, and so the reactants and products recombine with each other
  [ ] of reactants and products remains constant | They are being produced and destroyed at the same rate
   At eqm there is no change in macroscopic properties | They depend on the [ ] of mixtures
    Eqm can be reached from either direction | Self explanatory
