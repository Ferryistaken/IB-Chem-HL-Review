## 7.1: Introduction
### Understandings
- A state of [[Equilibrium]] is reached in a closed system when the [[Rates of Reaction]] of the forward and reverse reactions are equals.
- The [[Equilibrium law]] describes how the [[Equilibrium constant]] ($K_c$) can be determined for a particular chemical equation
- The reaction quotient ($Q$) measures the relative amount of products and reactants present during a reaction at a point in time.
