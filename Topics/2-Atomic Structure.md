# Topic 2: Atomic Structure

## 2.1 The nuclear atom
- Protons and Neutrons are present in the nucleus of [[Atoms]].
- Electrons occupy the space outside the nucleus and they are responsible for an atom's volume
- The **Atomic Number $Z$** is the number of protons
- The **Mass Number $A$** is the number of protons + neutrons
- **Isotopes** are atoms with the same **Atomic Number** but different **Mass Numbers**.
- We write species like this:
$$
^A_ZX
$$

$$
^{(Protons + Netrons)}_{(Protons)}Element
$$
- Where the number of protons is $Z$, the number of electrons is $Z$ and the number of neutrons is $A - Z$.
- The [[Relative atomic mass]] $A_r$ of an element is the average mass of an atom according to the relative abundances of its isotopes.

## 2.2 Electron Configuration
- The main energy levels of electrons in atoms are identified by integers $n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...$
- Each main [[energy level]] can hold a maximum of $2 n^2$ electrons
- Each main [[energy level]] contains $n$ sub-levels and $n^2$ orbitals.
- The **Electron Configuration** of an atom describes the number of electrons in each energy sub-level
- **Orbitals** are regions in space in which an electron may be found in [[Atoms]], each **orbital** can contain two electrons of opposite spin.

## 12.1 Electron Configuration
- The first [[Ionization Energy]] is the minimum energy required to remove one [[Moles|mole]] of electrons from one [[Moles|mole]] of gaseous atoms.
