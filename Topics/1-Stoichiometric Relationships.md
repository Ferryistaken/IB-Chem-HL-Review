# Topic 1: Stoichiometric Relationships

## 1.1 Introduction
- [[Atoms]] of different [[Elements]] combine in fixed ratios to form [[Compounds]], which have different properties from their components [[Elements]].
- Mixtures contain more than one element and/or compound that are not chemically bonded together and so retain their individual properties.
- Mixtures are either [[homogeneous]] or [[etherogeneous]].

## 1.2 The mole concept
- The amount **n** of a substance is measured in [[Moles]]

## 1.3 Reacting Masses and Volumes
- The [[limiting reactant]] determines the theoretical [[yield]] of product.
- The theoretical [[yield]] is the mass of produced according to the chemical equation, assuming 100% reaction of the [[limiting reactant]]
- The percentage [[yield]] is the experimental yield divided by the theoretical yield times 100
- The kelvin is the SI unit of temperature. $T(k) = T(C) + 273$
- The [[Ideal Gas Equation]] is $PV = nRT$, where $R$ is $8.31 J K^{-1}$  and $T$ must be in $K$
- Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy. See Topic [[6-Chemical kinetics]] for more.
