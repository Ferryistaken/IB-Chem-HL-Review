# Topic 3: Periodicity

## 3.1 The [[Periodic Table]]
- The [[Periodic Table]] arranges elements according to increasing atomic number / increasing number of protons
- The **rows** are called **periods**
- The **columns** are called **groups**
> - The **period number** is the outer [[energy level]] occupied by electrons
- Elements in the **same group** have the **same number of outer electrons** and have similar chemical properties
- The [[Periodic Table]] is divided in **4 blocks**:
	- **s**
	- **p**
	- **d**
	- **f**
- Which dictate the highest sub-level occupied by the electron.
- **Metals** are found on the **left** of the [[Periodic Table|periodic table]]
- **Non-Metals** are found on the right
	- **Group 1**: *Alkali* metals
	- **Group 17**: *Halogens*
	- **Group 18**: *Noble Gases*

## 3.2 [[Periodic Table#Trends|Periodic Trends]]
- **Along Periods** *(going up)*
	- [[Atomic radii]] decreases
	- [[Electron Affinity]] increases
	- [[Ionization Energy]] increases
- **Down Groups** *(going right)*
	- [[Atomic radii]] decreases
	- [[Electron Affinity]] increases
	- [[Ionization Energy]] increases
	- [[Electronegativity]] increases
- **Across** *(from bottom left to top right)*
	- **Nonmetallic Character** increases
	- **Metallic Character** decreases

## 13.1 First-row d-block elements
- Transition metals have partially filled d orbitals in their atoms or ions.
• Zn is not a transition element because it has a full d sub-level in its atoms and ions.
• Characteristic properties include: variable oxidation number, complex ion formation with [[Ligands|ligands]], existence of coloured compounds, have catalytic and magnetic properties.
• Multiple oxidation states arise because the 3d and 4s sub-levels are close in energy and both are involved in bonding.
• All d-block elements except Sc show an oxidation state of +2.
• All d-block elements except Zn show an oxidation state of +3.
• A [[Ligands|ligand]] is a molecule or negative ion that donates a pair of electrons to a central metal ion to form a covalent(coordinate) bond. They are Lewis bases.
• Complex ions are formed when a central metal ion is bonded to a [[Ligands|ligand]] with a coordinate bond. 
• The charge on a complex ion is the sum of the charges of the metal ion and the [[Ligands|ligands]].
• Transition metals act as heterogeneous catalysts as they can provide a surface for reaction: they use the 3d
and 4s electrons to form weak bonds to reactant molecules.
• Magnetic properties are a result of unpaired electrons in the transition metal atom or ion.

## 13.2 Coloured Examples
- Transition metal ions are coloured to to **d-d electron transitions** betweend d orbitals which are split
- The colour observed is complementary to the color observed
- Ions with higher charge and ligands with greater charge density produce a greater split in the d orbitals.
