# Chemical Compounds
## Main Concepts:
- [[Elements]] combined form compounds.
- They contain a fixed proportion of certain [[Elements]].
- The [[Elements]] are held together by chemical [[Bonds]], which change their properties radically, making the properties of a compound different than the ones of its [[Elements]].
- Can be found in nature.

### How they are described
Compounds are described by the chemical symbols for their elements.
A subscript is used to show the number of [[Atoms]] of each element.

#### Examples:
- $NaCl$
- $K_2O$
- $C_6H_{12}O_6$

---
The formation of compound from elements is an example of chemical change and can be represented by a [[Chemical Equations]].
