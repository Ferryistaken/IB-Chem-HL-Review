# Chemical Compounds
## Main Concepts:
- [[Elements]] combined form compounds.
- They contain a fixed proportion of certain [[Elements]].
- The [[Elements]] are held together by chemical [[Bonds]](Topic 4), which change their properties radically, making the properties of a compound different than the ones of its [[Elements]].
- Can be found in nature.
