# Molecular Formula
## Main concepts:
- The molecular formula shows all the atoms present in a molecule.
- A multiple of the [[empirical formula]].
- Can be deduced from the [[empirical formula]] if the [[molar mass]] is known.
- $\text{x (mass of empirical formula) = M, where x in an integer}$

### Problem:
Calomel is a compound with the [[empirical formula]] $HgCl$ and a [[molar mass]] of $472.08 \frac{g}{mol}$. What is its **molecular formula**?

Calculate the mass of the [[empirical formula]]:
$$\text{mass(HgCl) = } 200.59 + 35.45 = 236.04\frac{g}{mol}$$
Calculate the **molecular formula** knowing the ratio.
$$(236.04) \times x = M = 472.08$$
$$x = 2$$
Molecular Formula: $Hg_2Cl_2$.
