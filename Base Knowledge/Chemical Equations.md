# Chemical Equations
## Main Concepts:
- It's a representation of the simplest ratio of [[atoms]] which uses chemical symbols to show a chemical change.
- The elements on the left are called reactants, and the ones on the right are called products.
- The total number of [[atoms]] of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation.

### Balancing Equations
Since the total number of [[atoms]] of each element must be the same on both sides of the equation, we sometimes need to change the coefficients in order to make this rule be true. This is called balancing.
