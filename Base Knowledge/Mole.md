# The Mole
## Main Concepts
- The mass of substance that contains as many particles as there are atoms in 12g of carbon-12.
- The mole is a fixed number of particles and refers to the amount , **n**, of substance.
- A mole of a substance contains of the Avogadro constant of particles
- Masses of [[atoms]] are compared on a scale relative to $^{12}C$ and are expressed as relative atomic mass ($A_r$) and relative formula/molecular mass ($M_r$).
- Molar Mass (M) has the units $\frac{g}{mol}$.
- Avogadro's Constant: $6.02214086 Ã— 10^{23} mol^{-1}$

Avogadro's constant is the basis of the unit of **amount** used in chemistry known as [[mole]].

> Where Amount of substance is moles

Knowing the number of particles in a sample has it uses, but it's more useful to know the link between the Avogadro number and the mass of 1 mole of a substance, which is based on the [[relative atomic mass]].
