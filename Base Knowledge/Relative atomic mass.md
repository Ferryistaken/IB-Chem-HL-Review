# Relative atomic mass
## Main concepts
- Relative atomic mass is used to compare the masses of [[atoms]]
- The reference point of relative atomic mass if the carbon-12 isotope, which has a value of 12 units, so 1/12 of an atom of carbon-12 has a value of 1.
- $\text{relative  atomic mass } A_r = \frac{\text{weighted average of 1 atom of the element}}{\frac{1}{12}\text{ the mass of 1 atom of carbon-12}}$
- Values of $A_r$ don't have units because it's a relative form.

By expanding the concept of relative atomic mass to compounds, we can obtain the [[relative formula mass]], $M_r$.

By using the knowledge of Avogadro's number and Relative Atomic Mass, we can derive the concept of [[Molar Mass]].
